Here's how to work with the document (incomplete list by Gedeon after discussion on this in the meeting on the 25.10.2024)

Each subsystem's part of text should contain a description of the technical requirements, then a system description and, lastly, an overview of how the system fulfills the requirements, ideally funded by data of course.

The CDR document only contains final design choices.

The two main parts of the document are "Engine Description" and "Test Stand Description"
